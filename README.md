# Python codes for testing solutions to aggregation-type equations.

This repo contains:

- A general script for plotting solution to aggregation-diffusion equations and computing the convergence order either when the viscosity tends to 0 or when the discretization tends to 0
- A script which does the same thing for stationary solutions (requires the MpMath package)
- A illustration script to display the computed convergence order.

Much of the code has been written with the precious help of Benoit Fabr√®ges.
